This has been a really fun project and it really tested what I've been learning throughout TOP's Intermediate HTML/CSS section. What I struggled with the most was trying to get the project responsive for mobile as well as desktop. The project didn't require responsiveness, but I wanted to at least give it a try (it didn't work out that well). Lastly, I was able to use javascript to make sure the passwords were matching on top of the HTML pattern requiring passwords be at least 8 characters long, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 number.
